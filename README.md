3. Total of 90,398 people retiring soon. The number of employees retiring is pretty large. After further research into the data there are employees on the challenge_table_1 dataset who had a to_date that was not 9999-01-01. After removing those there is a total of 72,458 people retiring. Still a large number, but closer to being accurate.

4. With 72,458 employees on the roster for Pewlett Hackard that are likely to retire and only 1.549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, there will be a large deficit in qualified workers or even available workers to fill the positions. 

## Summary

Due to the large amount of employees prepared to retire in the coming years and the lack of qualified employees to fill those positions, there may be other criteria to expand the 'qualified' employees for mentorship. Analysis regarding length of time worked at the company or worked in various positions could also be a determining factor in who would be eligible for a mentorship program. All in all it seems that Pewlett Hackard has a a lot of work through mentorships and hiring to fill those vacant positions. It may also be good to evaluate this on a yearly basis to determine who will be closer to retirement and what can be done to prepare younger employees for available positions.
